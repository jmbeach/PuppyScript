# Parser Instructions

[Notes](http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs403/partree.html)

1) Copy recognizer
2) Figure out the parse tree for each rule on paper
3) Modify Lexeme classes to have a left and right pointer
4) Modify rules to return lexemes in tree format using left and right pointers of lexemes
5) Move on to [environments](http://beastie.cs.ua.edu/cs403/env.html)

Add pretty printing for an extra 10 points on final grade if you're not confident you'll implement evaluation correctly
